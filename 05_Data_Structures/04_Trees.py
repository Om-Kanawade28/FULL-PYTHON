# Tree:

# A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It's a non-linear data structure, unlike arrays and linked lists, which are linear.

# Key Concepts:

# - **Node:** A basic building block of a tree. Each node contains:
#     - **Data:** The actual value stored in the node.
#     - **Children:** References to other nodes that are directly connected to this node.
#     - **Parent:** A reference to the node that is directly above this node.

# - **Root:** The topmost node in the tree, which has no parent.

# - **Leaf:** A node that has no children.

# - **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.

# - **Level:** The distance of a node from the root. The root node is at level 0.

# - **Height:** The maximum level of any node in the tree.

# - **Degree:** The number of children a node has.

# Types of Trees:

# - **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children (left and right).
# - **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
# - **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing binary search tree that ensures a balanced structure to maintain efficient search operations.
# - **Heap:** A binary tree that satisfies the heap property:
#     - **Min-Heap:** The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
#     - **Max-Heap:** The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
# - **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings based on their prefixes.

# Advantages of Trees:

# - **Hierarchical Representation:** Trees are well-suited for representing hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational structures, and family trees.
# - **Efficient Search:** Binary search trees allow for efficient searching, with an average time complexity of O(log n).
# - **Sorting and Ordering:** Trees can be used for sorting and ordering data, such as in heap sort and binary search tree sorting.
# - **Data Compression:** Trees are used in
# Implementation:

# Here's a simple Python implementation of a binary tree:

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.root is None:
            self.root = new_node
            return

        current_node = self.root
        while True:
            if data < current_node.data:
                if current_node.left is None:
                    current_node.left = new_node
                    return
                else:
                    current_node = current_node.left
            else:
                if current_node.right is None:
                    current_node.right = new_node
                    return
                else:
                    current_node = current_node.right

    def inorder_traversal(self):
        def _inorder_traversal(node):
            if node:
                _inorder_traversal(node.left)
                print(node.data, end=" ")
                _inorder_traversal(node.right)

        _inorder_traversal(self.root)

# Usage:

tree = BinaryTree()
tree.insert(5)
tree.insert(3)
tree.insert(7)
tree.insert(2)
tree.insert(4)

print("Inorder traversal:", end=" ")
tree.inorder_traversal()  # Output: Inorder traversal: 2 3 4 5 7

# Applications:

# - **File Systems:**  Representing file and directory structures.
# - **Database Indexing:**  Used in indexing data for efficient retrieval.
# - **Decision Trees:**  Used in machine learning for classification and regression.
# - **Game Trees:**  Used in game AI for representing possible game states.
# - **Syntax Trees:**  Used in compilers for representing the structure of programs.

# Advanced Concepts:

# - **Tree Traversal:**  Visiting all nodes in a tree in a specific order (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).
# - **Tree Balancing:**  Maintaining a balanced tree structure to ensure efficient search operations.
# - **Tree Algorithms:**  Algorithms for searching, inserting, deleting, and finding the minimum or maximum values in a tree.

# Trees are a fundamental data structure with numerous applications in computer science. Understanding their concepts and implementation is essential for building efficient and organized data structures.
